# Windows-10-11-pro-Activation-WITH-NOT-ACTIVATORS
Hi! This is a way to activate Windows 10/11 (necessarily pro, otherwise it won't work!!!)
I saw this idea from the YouTuber FISPECKT (https://www.youtube.com/@FISPECKT)


Instruction manual: Download the bat file and run it as an Administrator. Go to the parameters and if everything went well, then you will have the inscription "Windows 10 (11) for workstations" in the Window versions field. Check "README"


How does it work? 
Microsoft has created a code (KMS) to activate any edition of Windows for workstations (a certain Windows Server). There is a special key for this program on their website (https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/get-started/kms-client-activation-keys). Therefore, you can activate your Windows on the principle of an activator, but with a guarantee that it is virus-free.
